                <p>Blackpink (Hangul: ë¸ëíí¬; stylized as BLACKPINK or BLÎÆKPIÐK) is a South Korean girl group formed by
                    YG Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Lisa, and RosÃ©.</p>

                <p>The group debuted on August 8, 2016, with their single album Square One, which spawned "Whistle",
                    their first number-one song in South Korea, as well as "Boombayah", their first number-one hit on
                    the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, which set the record as the most-viewed debut music video
                    by a Korean act. With the group's early commercial success, they were hailed as the New Artist of
                    the Year at the 31st Golden Disc Awards and the 26th Seoul Music Awards.

                    As of 2018, Blackpink is the highest-charting female K-pop act on both Billboard Hot 100 and
                    Billboard 200, peaking at number 55 with "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du", and peaking at number 40 with Square Up,
                    respectively. They are also the first and only K-pop girl group to enter and top Billboard's
                    Emerging Artists chart. They are also the first female K-pop group to have four number-one singles
                    on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart. At the time of its release, "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" was the
                    most-viewed music video in 24 hours on YouTube, and in January 2019, it became the most viewed music
                    video by a K-pop group on YouTube.</p>
