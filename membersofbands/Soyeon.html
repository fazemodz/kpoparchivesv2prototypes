        <h2 class="title">Who is jeon soyeon?</h2><br>


        <p>
            Jeon So-yeon (Hangul: ì ìì°; born August 26, 1998), better known mononymously as Soyeon,
            is a South Korean rapper, singer, choreographer, songwriter and record producer signed to Cube
            Entertainment.
            She is the leader of Korean girl group (G)I-dle. She is best known for competing in the
            television shows Produce 101 and Unpretty Rapstar.<br>
            <h2 class="title">2016â2017: Produce 101, Unpretty Rapstar and Solo Debut.</h2>
            In January 2016, Soyeon appeared as a representative trainee for Cube Entertainment on the first season of
            the girl group survival show, Produce 101. She remained a popular contestant throughout the show's run,
            peaking at 10th place on the fifth episode.
            However, she ranked at number 20 on the last episode and failed to become a member of the winning girl
            group, I.O.I.
            In July 2016, Soyeon appeared as a contestant in the third season of the rap competition show Unpretty
            Rapstar. The show finished with Soyeon as the second runner-up, gaining three tracks on the show's final
            compilation album.
            On December 29, 2016, Soyeon signed an exclusive contract as an artist under Cube Entertainment. She
            officially debuted on November 5, 2017 with the digital singles "Jelly" and "Idle Song" which she wrote
            herself.

                <h2 class="title">2018âPresent: Debut with (G)I-dle and collaborations.</h2>
                <p>
                    On January 11, 2018, it was announced that Soyeon would be re-debuting in Cube Entertainment's new
                    girl group (G)I-dle as the leader and main rapper. She is credited in the lyrics, music
                    and arrangement for both their debut song 'LATATA' and their comeback song 'HANN (Alone)', both of which
                    was well received and commercially successful. She also contributed in writing five songs of
                    (G)I-dle's debut extended play titled I AM.

                    On August 8, it was announced that Soyeon would participate in a girl group project called Station
                    Young for SM Station's X 0 alongside Red Velvet's Seulgi, Kim Chung-ha, and GFriend's SinB.
                    Station Young released their first song, "Wow Thing", on September 28, 2018.

                    In February 2018, Soyeon and fellow (G)I-dle member Miyeon were approached by Riot Games to
                    participate in a collaboration project with American artists Jaira Burns and Madison Beer as part of
                    a virtual girl group called "K/DA" for the multiplayer online battle arena video game League of
                    Legends. Soyeon, Miyeon, Beer, and Burns recorded vocals for the virtual group, which consists of
                    new versions of League of Legends characters. K/DA officially debuted with the song "Pop/Stars"
                    during the 2018 League of Legends World Championship on November 3, 2018. The official music
                    video for "POP/STARS" was released on the same day, reaching 30 million views on YouTube in five
                    days, and 100 million in one month. The single release of the song reached the number one
                    position on Billboard's World Digital Songs chart. The K/DA incarnation of the character Akali,
                    whose vocals were performed by Soyeon, proved to be especially popular, becoming a frequent subject
                    of fan art and cosplay.
